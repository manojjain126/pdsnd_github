### Description
##Bike Share Data

This repository contains data for three major US cities' bike share systems: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The data was collected by Motivate, a bike share system provider.

The data includes the following information for each trip:

 * Start Time
 * End Time
 * Trip Duration (in seconds)
 * Start Station
 * End Station
 * User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
 * Gender (for Chicago and New York City only)
 * Birth Year (for Chicago and New York City only)

 The data can be used to explore bike share usage patterns. For example, you could use the data to answer questions like:

 * What are the most popular times of day for bike share trips?
 * What are the most popular stations for starting and ending bike share trips?
 * How long are the average bike share trips?
 * Who are the most common users of bike share systems?

I hope this data is helpful for your research!
